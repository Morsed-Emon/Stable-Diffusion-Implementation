This project focuses on generating high-quality synthetic iris images using a Stable Diffusion model. The primary objective is to synthesize realistic iris images that preserve key identity features of the original images, enabling secure and privacy-preserving biometric applications.

Motivation:
Biometric systems rely heavily on large, diverse datasets for effective training and evaluation. However, collecting iris data is challenging due to privacy concerns and data scarcity. This project aims to address these challenges by using generative models to augment iris datasets, thereby improving model performance while protecting user identities.
